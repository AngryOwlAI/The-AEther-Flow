# Compact Current Frontier v16

This generated index mirrors `output/compact_current_frontier_v16.yaml` and `output/compact_current_frontier_v16.json`. It is a snapshot-only reader aid. If it differs from tracked control state, tracked control state governs.

Live validation recomputes the full source manifest and commit lag.
Freshness PASS is operational evidence only; it is not physics proof

## High-Risk Rows

| Burden ID | Reader-facing status | Control | Physical | Promotion |

| `g_eff` | ScopedMetricStructureRecord_src adopted as the scoped source-extension record; g_eff^{GSC-cand} retained as exact legacy alias | gate_review_completed | not_unscoped_lorentzian_metric_not_matter_coupling_not_einstein_equations | scoped_source_object_only |
| `matter_coupling` | open target matter-coupling derivation after protected source-side postulate adoption | accepted_as_scoped_evidence_precondition | not_matter_coupling_not_stress_energy_not_matter_action_not_detector_semantics | scoped_source_evidence_only |

## Positive-First Status Cards

These cards render high-risk rows in the required order: positive status, exact scope, allowed use, and blocked overread. They are operational calibration only and do not create physics proof authority.

| Object | Positive status | Scope | Allowed use | Blocked overread | Next burden |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `m_src` | M_src is adopted only as a scoped source-only M_src object. | The adoption applies only under the declared source-only GSC candidate scope and fail-closed boundary. | Later bounded packets may use it as source-side prerequisite context. | not a target manifold<br>not a metric<br>not MetricData(E) scope expansion<br>not g_eff scope expansion<br>not matter coupling<br>not Einstein equations<br>not benchmark promotion<br>not completed derivation | Use scoped M_src only as source-side prerequisite context while deriving any later metric or coupling bridge without target-manifold or target-metric import. |
| `g_eff` | ScopedMetricStructureRecord_src is the primary name for the adopted scoped source-extension record; g_eff^{GSC-cand} is its exact legacy alias. | The adoption applies only to the exact declared source-extension candidate scope reviewed in RT-20260614-222. | Later bounded packets may use ScopedMetricStructureRecord_src as scoped source-extension context and may use g_eff^{GSC-cand} only as its explicit exact legacy alias. | bare g_eff remains an unresolved burden<br>not an unscoped Lorentzian metric<br>not MetricData(E) adoption<br>not unscoped g_eff<br>not matter coupling<br>not Einstein equations<br>not benchmark promotion<br>not completed derivation | Independently review the full Gate B package while using ScopedMetricStructureRecord_src as the scoped record and keeping bare g_eff unresolved. |
| `matter_coupling` | The unchanged finite P7SourceMatterPackage_v1 is adopted as canonical physical source matter by explicit protected human postulate. | The adoption is limited to the exact P7-T01 through P7-T06 source-side package, its declared finite domains, and the current continuum-first source architecture. | Later bounded packets may use the exact adopted source-matter meanings as scoped P8 input while independently constructing or obstructing g_eff-dependent target coupling. | not source-law adoption<br>not target matter semantics<br>not target detector semantics<br>not unscoped or target coupling-law adoption<br>not matter-coupling derivation<br>not target matter-coupling adoption<br>not target stress-energy semantics or tensor<br>not target matter action<br>not coupling through a derived g_eff<br>not Einstein equations<br>not benchmark promotion<br>not completed derivation | Derive or precisely obstruct the g_eff-dependent source-to-target coupling bridge without treating the protected source-side postulate as a derivation. |
| `einstein_equations` | einstein_equations remains blocked with open continuation and no positive derivation status. | No Einstein-equation premise, derivation, benchmark closure, or completed derivation has been established. | Later bounded packets may use this row only as a visible downstream burden and claim-boundary guard. | not field equations derived<br>not dynamics or action established<br>not matter coupling established<br>not benchmark closure<br>not completed derivation | Derive lawful dynamics/action/variation and matter coupling under protected gates before any Einstein-equation derivation claim. |
| `benchmark_promotion` | benchmark_promotion remains blocked by upstream derivation burdens and protected authority. | No exact-GR benchmark promotion, benchmark closure, fit claim, Gate Chair verdict, or completed derivation follows from scoped evidence/preconditions. | Later bounded packets may use this row only as a protected downstream authority boundary. | not benchmark promoted<br>not exact-GR derivation complete<br>not benchmark fit accepted<br>not Gate Chair verdict<br>not completed derivation | Complete upstream derivation burdens and protected Gate Chair benchmark review before any benchmark promotion or completed-derivation claim. |
